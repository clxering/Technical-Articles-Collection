# Contributing Guide

Iâ€™m really excited that you are interested in contributing to this project. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Always use an organized format or template to create new issues.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest release. All operation should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- If adding new improvement:
  - Provide convincing reason to add this improvement. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - If you are resolving a issue, add `(closes #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update Item 19 (closes #1899)`.
